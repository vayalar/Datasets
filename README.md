This repository contains datasets used in the research activities of the **Performance Engineering Laboratory** at the [School of Computer Science (University College Dublin)](http://www.csi.ucd.ie).

Datasets
----------------------
This repository contains the following datasets:

### 1. [Irish Census Datasets] (https://github.com/ucd-pel/Datasets/tree/master/IrishCensus) ###

The generated datasets correspond to microdata containing records with social, economic and demographic data which mimics the distribution of aggregated statistics from the 2011 Irish Census data. More details about the values of each attribute, the methodology followed to generate these datasets, and how the datasets were used in experiments of anonymization can be found at the following papers:

### 2. [Insurance Datasets] (https://github.com/ucd-pel/Datasets/tree/master/Insurance) ###

These datasets correspond to tabular data containing records with social and demographic information from individuals. This information coresponds to attributes such as their age, occupation, workplace, favorite recreational activity and places where this is practiced. Moreover, this datasets contain two classification attributes (risk of accident and salary class).
