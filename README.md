This repository contains synthetic datasets generated by research activities of Vanessa Ayala-Rivera during her work at the **Performance Engineering Laboratory** at the [School of Computer Science and Informatics (University College Dublin)](http://www.csi.ucd.ie).

Datasets
----------------------
This repository contains the following datasets:

### 1. [Irish Census Datasets] (https://github.com/vayalar/GSL_Data/tree/master/Datasets/Irish%20Census) ###

The generated datasets correspond to microdata containing records with social, economic and demographic data which mimics the distribution of aggregated statistics from the 2011 Irish Census data. More details about the methodology followed to generate this dataset can be found in the technical report available at: (https://www.csi.ucd.ie/content/synthetic-data-generation-using-benerator-tool)

### 2. [Insurance Datasets](https://github.com/vayalar/GSL_Data/tree/master/Datasets/Insurance) ###

The generated datasets correspond to microdata containing records with social and demographic information from individuals. This information coresponds to attributes such as their age, occupation, workplace, favorite recreational activity and places where this is practiced.
